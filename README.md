[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carrot/go-base-api.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/carrot/go-base-api)

Carrots Base API scaffolding for Go.  We use [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) as our base framework.

This is a Go implementation of our [RESTful API Spec](https://github.com/carrot/restful-api-spec).

## Getting Started

Clone this project into your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable).

The project by default is set up to point at `github.com/carrot/go-base-api`, but you can change that to whatever you'd like.  Just be sure to update all references in the code to match your new location.

#### Multiple Environment Support

This base supports multiple environments:

- development
- testing
- staging
- production

You will run this project with `./go-base-api {target-environment}`.  For example:

```
./go-base-api development
```

#### Environment Variables

We use [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) (a Go port of [bkeepers/dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv))to manage environment variables.

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.{target-environment}`, and update the values in the `.env.{target-environment}` file.

You'll also need to globally set this environment variable:

```sh
# Always set as 1, to manage dependencies
export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1
```

#### Database

We manage our database migrations with [originator](https://github.com/DigitalCitadel/originator).  To start off, [get that installed](https://github.com/DigitalCitadel/originator#installation) on your machine.

After you have originator installed, cd into `originator-files/config` and run `mkdir $(hostname)` to create a directory to hold your machine-specific config.

The only config file that will have to be added to your machine-specific config is the `database_config.bash` file.  So go ahead and copy that from the default folder into your machine specific config folder.  Go and update your database config file to match your specific database setup.

After you've updated the file, you can go and navigate to the root of the project and run `originator migrate` to run all of the current migrations.  Your database should now be set up.

#### Dependencies + Building

We manage our dependencies in this project with [gom](https://github.com/mattn/gom).  So to start off, you're going to have to install that:

```sh
go get github.com/mattn/gom
```

After you've installed gom, you can run the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh
gom install
```

After you have the dependencies installed, you can build the project:

```sh
gom build
```

An executable file with the name of the root folder should now appear in the current directory.  You can run this and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`.  If you receive a page that says `Not Found` you're all set up!

#### Testing

To run tests, run `gom test`.

Tests should be written to automatically load `.env.testing` (but not fail if it's not there) and as a user of the tests you should have your `.env.testing` file filled out.

If you're testing this on Travis CI, set up the environment variables as you traditionally would with Travis and run normally.

## Main

## Controllers

Controllers are responsible for directly managing what happens during a request.  Every endpoint maps to a controller method.

To keep things clean, we have one controller per model (with the name {Model}Controller) and all handlers are methods.

We follow [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) as the naming convention for all of our controller methods, with the exception of Read, which we use `Index` for bulk fetches, and `Show` for single fetches.

## Database

We have configurations for both Redis and PostgreSQL.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is very likely going to be your primary datastore if you are building out a larger API.

We have details of how to get PostgreSQL up and running in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of this README.

We use [lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) as our database driver, but you really don't have to know that as it's already been abstracted away in our `db/postgres` package.  You will simply be interfacing with Golangs [database/sql](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/).

## Middleware

This contains a set of commonly used middleware created for use with the Echo framework.

- `Recover` - Recovers from `panic` calls. It's based off of the Echo-provided middleware of the same name but updated to fit our specific JSON interface model.

## Models

Models are responsible for storing, updating data, and exposing data to the application.  They are the interface between the database and the rest of the application.

We use one file per model, and store them in the `models/` directory and the name of the file is the `snake_case` version of the primary struct inside.

We use [methods](https://gobyexample.com/methods) for fetching/manipulating single model structs, and [functions](https://gobyexample.com/functions) for bulk fetching models.

We try to follow the naming conventions as described in this interface for all methods.  We don't actually enforce the interface in code, as most applications don't require every one of these methods for all models.

```go
type Model interface {
    Load(id int64) error    // Loads the contents of model entry with ID into current struct
    Save() error            // Saves the state of the current struct into the DB
    Update() error          // Updates the state of the current struct to the DB
    Delete() error          // Removes the current struct from the DB
}
```

## Responses

The `response` package contains both consistent error code/messages as well as helpers to format JSON responses.

### Usage

#### Success

```go

func HomePage(c *echo.Context) error {
  resp := response.New(c)
  defer resp.Render()

  content := SimpleLogic()

  resp.SetResponse(http.StatusOK, content)
  return nil
}
```

#### Error

Note: `AddError` may be called more than once to indicate multiple errors as could happen with form validations.

```go
func HomePage(c *echo.Context) error {
  resp := response.New(c)
  defer resp.Render()

  content, err := ComplexLogic()

  if err != nil {
    resp.AddError(response.ErrorInternalServerError)
    resp.SetResponse(http.StatusInternalServerError, nil)
    return nil
  }

  resp.SetResponse(http.StatusOK, content)
  return nil
}

```

#### Defaults

By using `defer` on `Render()` we can ensure that, even in the case of a `panic`, the response will still be rendered.
As a catch-all, the default response is set to the following:

```go
Response{
  Success: false,
  StatusCode: 500,
  StatusText: "Internal Server Error",
  Errors: [],
  Content: nil,
}
```
